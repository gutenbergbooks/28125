<p>Kate and Dick had a good many pets. There were Frisk and Ponto and
Fuss and another little dog called Fly. There was the pony, Fleet, and
the newest pet of all was a dear little colt that Kate's papa had
given to her for her very own because the pony she rode really
belonged to Dick.</p>

<p>This colt she had named Fairy, and she took great care of it. Fly and
Fairy were good friends, and they had a funny way of looking at each
other that made the children laugh.</p>

<p>Then the baby that they all loved lived here. Her name was May, and
she was Kate's sister. She was a sweet little thing, just beginning to
walk and to talk. She could say "chicky" quite plainly, and she liked
to toddle out and watch the little girls feed the chickens.</p>

<p>But I can't begin to tell you all the good times the children had that
summer. They were happy all the time, and grandma said they were so
good that it was really no trouble at all to have them there.</p>

                                                                        <!-- page 26 -->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page06.png" alt="" width="346" height="430" />

<p>But at last one Saturday evening, papa, who always came out from the
city to spend Sunday with them, said they must start for home the next
Monday.</p>

<p>They did want to stay longer, but papa laughed and said, "Christmas is
coming now, you know, and Santa Claus couldn't bring things way out
here as easy as he could get them to you in town."</p>

<p>Then the children began to think of Christmas and to tease grandpa and
grandma to come and spend it with them, and of course papa and mamma
teased too; so at last they promised, and the children said good-by to
their pets and to Kate and May and Dick and went away shouting?</p>

<p>"Good-by, grandma. Now remember you promised!"</p>
                                                                       <!-- page 27 -->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the children reached home they talked of grandma's nearly all
the time when they were not talking of Christmas, and Bessie wrote a
letter to Santa Claus asking him to be sure and bring a pair of his
nicest gold-bowed spectacles for grandma because she had lost her old
ones, and not to forget a gold-headed cane for grandpa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At last Christmas Eve came, and grandma and grandpa were there, and
the children hung up their stockings, and Bessie said that grandma and
grandpa must be sure and hang up theirs too; then, after they had gone
to bed, the smaller children whispered for a long time about Santa
Claus and listened to hear his sleigh bells on the roof.</p>

<p>"I don't see how he can get down the chimney," whispered Bessie. "You
know he's so fat in all his pictures."</p>

<p>"Maybe he takes off his coat," whispered Clara, "then he wouldn't be
quite so big." But she didn't see how he could get down the chimney,
either.</p>

<p>Once or twice they were sure they heard him on the roof, and they<!-- page 29 -->
covered up their heads so he wouldn't think they were peeping, and at
last they went to sleep before they knew it.</p>

<p>Willie and Tom were just as anxious as the little girls, and whispered
just as much, and they all dreamed of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>
<img src="images/page08b.png" alt="" width="341" height="258" /></p>

<p>Bessie and Clara were the first ones up. They shouted with delight
when they looked in their stockings. There was a dear little dolly in
each stocking&mdash;a dolly with real hair and eyes that opened and shut,
and the dollies were dressed very prettily. They were too large to go
into the stockings, so they just stood in them, looking as though they
were ready to jump down.</p>

<p>Willie found the funniest jumping-jack in his stocking, and Tom pulled
a flute out of his. He had everybody awake in no time after that.</p>

<p>Grace was happy when she looked in her stocking. There was a little<!-- page 30 -->
plush box in it, and in the box was a lovely gold watch; while Harry
found just what he wanted too&mdash;a pair of skates.</p>

<p>But grandma and grandpa were surprised when they discovered the
spectacles and the cane.</p>

<p>"Who in the world could have told Santa what we wanted most?" said
grandma.</p>

<p>Grandpa said he couldn't understand it either, and then Bessie had to
tell the secret.</p>

<p>She ran up to each of them and whispered, "I wrote to him myself!"</p>

<p>Then how they kissed her.</p>

<p>All day long the library was kept closed; not a child was allowed to
peep in. But what fun they had all day, and what a Christmas dinner,
with a plum pudding as big as a pumpkin.</p>

<p>In the evening the library door was opened, and there was the
prettiest Christmas tree, all blazing with candles and hung with
pretty things; while piled around it were books and toys and
everything that everybody wanted most.</p>

<p>And just think of it! There, lying in front of the tree and looking as
happy as the children themselves, was a great, big, noble dog, who got
up and came to meet them as they trooped in.</p>

<p>"Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!" cried Bessie, bending to pat his head. "What's your<!-- page 31 -->
name, you great, big darling? Ooo! Ooo! Whose is he, papa?"</p>

<p>"Ask Santa Claus," said papa; and sure enough, Santa Claus stepped out
from behind the tree.</p>

<p>"His name is on his collar," said Santa Claus. Then the children all
rushed for him for they knew it was grandpa dressed up like Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>
<img src="images/page10.png" alt="" width="350" height="234" /></p>

<p>Afterwards Bessie spelled out the dog's name, "C-a-r-l-o," on his
collar, and her own name on a card which was tied to it, and she was
the happiest little girl in the world.</p>

<p>But everyone else was happy too, and they all said it was the very
merriest Christmas they had ever seen, and Clara and Bessie dreamed
that Santa Claus told them he himself had never had so much fun before.</p>

<p class="cap">ONE summer Alma and her brother Philip spent their vacation with their
auntie, who lived in a beautiful village, so near the pretty country
that they could take a ride out into it on their wheels, at any time
they wished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page32b" id="page32b"></a>
<img src="images/page32b.png" alt="" width="421" height="258" /></p>

<p>They both rode very well indeed, and they were always finding pretty
little spots along the road-side, where they played camp out; for
auntie let them take a lunch if they wanted to, and the air was so
fresh and pure that they were hungry almost all the time.</p>

                                                                        <!-- page 33 -->

<img class="floatl" src="images/page33a.png" alt="" width="119" height="103" />

<p>One morning they started off quite early with their wheels and their
lunch, and they rode out into the country on a pretty road where they
had never been before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page33b.png" alt="" width="195" height="101" />

<p>It had great trees along the side and a little river winding along
with it, and they saw the cattle and horses in the fields, and the
hens and chickens and turkeys and geese along the road-side, and once
they got off their wheels to talk to a pretty bossy and her calf that
were very near the fence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page33c" id="page33c"></a>
<img src="images/page33c.png" alt="" width="344" height="149" /></p>

<p>The bossy was a little afraid they might hurt her baby, so she wasn't
quite friendly. But she didn't try to drive them away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page33d.png" alt="" width="167" height="94" />

                                                                        <!-- page 34 -->
<p>At one side of a farm-house near, a big dog was lying in his kennel,
and a great black cat came up to him very slyly and tapped him on the
nose with one paw. It was funny to see the dog jump up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34a.png" alt="" width="169" height="160" />

<p>The birds sang, and the hens and chickens talked to each other, and
once or twice they stopped to let a flock of geese cross the road in
front of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page34b.png" alt="" width="144" height="112" />

<p>Then they came upon a big flock of turkeys, and the gobbler put on
airs and pretended he was going to stop them; but they flew past and
laughed at him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34c.png" alt="" width="126" height="107" />

<p>By the side of the road in one place, a big, fat, clean-looking pig
was standing, sunning himself; but when he saw them, he ran away,
squealing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page34d.png" alt="" width="172" height="100" />

<p>"You needn't run from us," Philip called after him; "we don't want any
pork to-day&mdash;we've got chicken for our lunch."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page34e.png" alt="" width="120" height="109" />

<p>"Yes," said Alma, "and nice, fresh strawberries, and everything good."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page35a.png" alt="" width="137" height="121" /><!-- page 35 -->

<p>They saw a big dog lying near a chicken-coop, with the chickens
running over him just as they pleased, and Philip called out again,"Be
careful, you little fellows, or you might happen to run down his
throat."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page35b.png" alt="" width="161" height="99" />

<p>They got off their wheels and walked for a little while just for fun;
and all at once, as they were passing a barn, Alma cried, "Look! Did
you see that cat after the mouse?"</p>

<p>Philip said he didn't; but pretty soon Mrs Pussy came out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="illustration"><a name="page35c" id="page35c"></a>
<img src="images/page35c.png" alt="" width="353" height="167" /></p>

<p>"You didn't get it, did you?" said Alma. "Well, you're fat enough now;
you don't need to catch mice."</p>

<p>They stopped to eat their lunch under a clump of trees not very far
from a pleasant farm-house. There was a cunning little fat dog lying
in front of the house, and as they watched him, up came a bee and lit
on his nose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36a.png" alt="" width="179" height="126" /><!-- page 36 -->
<p>The little doggy jumped up and barked at the bee; then he sat down and
put up his nose in a friendly way, to see what it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page36b.png" alt="" width="216" height="129" />

<p>"Look out, sir!" cried Philip. "You'll get hurt!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36c.png" alt="" width="157" height="168" />

<p>But he spoke just a little too late, for puppy-dog found out his
mistake, and the next minute he was running away and yelping at the
top of his voice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatl" src="images/page36d.png" alt="" width="188" height="125" />

<p>"The poor little thing!" said Alma. "Wasn't that too bad?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img class="floatr" src="images/page36e.png" alt="" width="136" height="91" />

<p>"Yes," said Philip, "but he'll get over it pretty quick, and I can't
help laughing, it did look so funny."</p>

<p>When they went back to their auntie's, they told her that was the best
bicycle ride they had ever had.</p>
